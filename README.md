# LA Crime Analysis (2020-Present) - Python

## Overview

This project analyzes crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) covering the period from January 1, 2020, to September 16, 2024.
The findings in this analysis aim to support stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to enhance public safety in Los Angeles. <br> 

**Questions I answer through my analysis are**
- What does the distribution of crime look like per year and month?  
  (Which months have the highest crime rates? Which year had the highest crime rate?)

- What were the most common crimes in the month and year that recorded the highest crime rates?
- Which ethnicities had the highest number of victims?  

- What is the most common crime committed against victims under 18 years of age? Under 10 years of age?  

- What are the most frequently used weapons in crimes?  

- Which area has had the highest reported crime rate since 2020?  

- Which area has a higher number of female versus male crime victims?  

- Are there any crimes with a significant reporting delay?
